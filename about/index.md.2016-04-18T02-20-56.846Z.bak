_Welcome to Credit Card Andy - a blog that makes personal finance easy to understand for students and 20-somethings._

My name is Andrew Kim. I am a recent graduate of Dartmouth College where I studied Economics.

I am a self-described Wannabe-Hipster (check out the sweet polaroid effect I got going on over there on the right) who loves golf, peanut butter, and quoting Anchorman. I'm also addicted to technology and gadgets. You can find me on a Sunday afternoon tinkering and experimenting with my electronic gizmos.

#### My Story

I was the 7-year-old kid who enjoyed depositing birthday money into his savings account more than buying a new toy. In middle school, I started noticing credit card commercials on TV. They were saying things like "cash back" and "rewards". I wanted in, but I was too young to apply. When I suggested to my parents that they should use these awesome cards, they said, "No, we prefer debit cards". I asked them what the difference between was between the two, and they weren't too sure themselves.

Fast forward to college. I had a student credit card, checking account, and savings account all from the same bank my parents used. _**I didn't know when to use my credit card vs. my debit card. I didn't know how to pay the credit card bill. I didn't**__** understand why this one didn't give me points**._ I was clueless. So I set out on a journey to figure it all out.

As I was learning it all, I really got into it. I was reading the fine print of credit cards, learning the minutia of bank accounts, and conjuring up new ways to optimize my finances. A lot of the tinkering spirit I developed with technology came into play as I worked out my financial strategy.

Throughout college, I realized my friends didn't even know the basics of money. How are students supposed to function in the real world post-graduation if they don't know what to do with their own money?
